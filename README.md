# Kudos Contract

This contract is deployed to the mainnet at [0x2aea4add166ebf38b63d09a75de1a7b94aa24163](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2aea4add166ebf38b63d09a75de1a7b94aa24163) and on rinkeby at [0x4077aE95EeC529D924571d00e81ECdE104601AE8](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x4077aE95EeC529D924571d00e81ECdE104601AE8)

[Here is a link to the security audit which was performed by ZKLabs before launch.](docs/audit_report.pdf).

## Getting started
First you need to install all of the requirements to run truffle and a local testrpc.

- `npm install -g truffle ganache-cli` to install Truffle and Ganache-cli.
- `npm install` to install npm requirements.

Truffle will use the "development" network by default.  This assumes that you are running a testrpc on localhost at port 8545.

## Running the tests
- `truffle test --network test`

## Developing on Gitcoin Web
The source repository (in development) is here -- https://github.com/mbeacom/kudos.

Kudos relies on the blockchain to mint the tokens.  After each token is minted, the data in sycn'ed to the database.  The Gitcoin docker-compose.yml file runs an instance of the `testrpc`, which is your local blockchain.

Once the docker-compose environment and testrpc is up, you can deploy the contract code.  If you run `docker-compose logs -f testrpc` while you deploy the contract, you can see the Contract address in the debug output.

- `truffle migrate --reset --build-all` to build and deploy the Kudos.sol contract.


## Developing on the Test App (Deprecated)

To run the blockchain and app locally:

- In a separate window, run `ganache-cli`.  It should now be running locally on port 8545.
- `truffle migrate --reset --build-all` to build and deploy the Kudos.sol contract.
- `npm run dev` to start up the web server.  The app should be running locally on port 300.
- Copy the `(0)` private key and import it into Meta Mask in your browser.  This is the default account that Tokens will be minted to.  You should have around ~97 ETH to 
play with.
